# Direct and indirect impacts of industrial action on emergency department attendances in England, 2022-2024: A causal mediation analysis with 20 hospitals
Between December 2022 and July 2024, the English National Health Service saw 27 periods of industrial action over 78 days, involving hospital and ambulance staff. In this analysis we estimate the direct and indirect (i.e. causally mediated) impacts of industrial action on the Emergency Department (ED) durations.

The analysis has been summarised in a manuscript that will be submitted to a academic journal  for consideration and review.

The repository contains a series of SQL and R code files.  Some of these must be run within the National Commissioning Data Reoistiry (NCDR) managed by NHS England.
